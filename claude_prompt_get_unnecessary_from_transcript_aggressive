Your job is to make this transcript more concise. Please read the transcript, then think quietly about what the core important points are in the transcript. What parts of the transcript could be removed to make it flow better, and to be more concise and clear. Now, add brackets to indicate which parts of the transcript you want to remove.

You should be very aggressive in cutting out any parts of the transcript that aren't very important. Try to make it so the remaining parts of the transcript are only the really important parts. But don't change the meaning of the content, either.

When you respond, you should surround each of the unnecessary parts of the transcript with square brackets. Here is an example:

I guess in the end, all I'm saying is, space is a really big place, man.
