Your job is to take this transcript with the unnecessary parts removed via brackets, and this json object which shows the timestamps of each word. From this you should return a list of segments to keep.

Here's an example:

Input:

"Hello [uh there] my name is John and I'm a developer [at Google]"

{
  "Hello": [0, 0.5],
  "uh": [0.5, 0.7],
  "there": [0.7, 1.0],
  "my": [1.0, 1.5],
  "name": [1.5, 2.0],
  "is": [2.0, 2.5],
  "John": [2.5, 3.0],
  "and": [3.0, 3.5],
  "I'm": [3.5, 4.0],
  "a": [4.0, 4.5],
  "developer": [4.5, 5.0],
  "at": [5.0, 5.5],
  "Google": [5.5, 6.0]
}

Response:

{
  "result":

[
  [0, 0.5],
  [1.0, 5.0],
]

}


Remember that your response must be valid JSON. Please do not respond with any explanations or anything just JSON like in the example above.


Ok let's go


Input:

((REPLACE_ME_WITH_BRACKETED))

((REPLACE_ME_WITH_TIMESTAMPED))
